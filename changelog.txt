2026-01-06:
- Implemented the Brualdi and Dahl algorithm for finding RCDS matrices corresponding to a skeleton. erdosify_bd function in erdos_finder.py does this.
- The config method controls which algorithm to use kt or bd (i.e. Kushwaha-Tripathi or Brualdi Dahl).

2026-01-03:
- Added sample_proportion.py. This file uses a random sample of [Marco-Polo]sample_size binary matrices and finds out how many of them are admissible skeletons and then how many of those admit an Erdos matrix.

2026-01-02:
- erdos_failure_stats.py: Added some stats on simplices.

2025-12-20:
- Moved all pickle files to pickles/ folder.
- Added [reps]max_time in config.ini
- Increased safeguards to KeyboardInterrupt -ing execution of reps_multi_flat.py during execution. This has however never occurred.
